The advantage of using a text editor is that it can do things like automatically indent, highlight specific syntaxes,
makes it easier to find and replace code, allow extensions and plugins, and have a very low resource usage on your computer.


The advantage to using a relative URL vs an absolute URl is the level of flexibility. Relative URLs aren't tied to a specific domain, so they are easier to
move to a new website. Relative URLs are also typically a little faster than absolute URLs. Absolute URLs are better for search engines in terms of being able
to be indexed more accurately due to absolute URLs requiring a complete URL.
